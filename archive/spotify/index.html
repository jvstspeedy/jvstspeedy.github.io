  <div class="pl-4"><p>Spotify sucks dick.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Since becoming an artist, I've become much more aware of just how shit the music industry is for indie artists, and it's put me in a position where the more I learn about the companies I submit my music to, the more I absolutely fucking hate them. Spotify is, at least as far as I know, the worst offender.</p>
<h1 id="history-of-spotify">History of Spotify</h1>
<p>Spotify was, and always has been, an ad serving platform first.</p>
<p>The earliest days of Spotify didn't even have legitimate music on the platform, it was just a bunch of mp3s downloaded from piratebay, or whatever other piracy site they decided to use. Eventually they started getting more traction and got more investments so they could get real artists on the platform, but the idea from the beginning was to make money. Serving ads is their main purpose, and that's why you either pay them a fuckload of money for lower-than-intended quality music or you aren't allowed to skip more than 6 times and you have to be subjected to ads every 30 minutes.</p>
<p>It's <em><strong>awful.</strong></em></p>
<h1 id="modern-streaming-landscape">Modern Streaming Landscape</h1>
<p>The current state of streaming ANYTHING, not just music is also awful. It changes the way culture is enjoyed. You used to go out and buy a vinyl record, or a cassette, or a CD, and proceed to enjoy that at home with the excitement of having a new piece of music. But now you just open your phone, click play, and you get an algorithmicly determined shuffle of songs to keep you engaged as long as possible so you provide more ad money to the company.</p>
<p>I may sound like an old man yelling at clouds here, but I genuinely believe the "right" way to listen to most music is via physical media, or at the very least to listen to a whole album at a time. This, however, isn't how music is released anymore.</p>
<p>One of my favorite artists, <a href="https://music.youtube.com/channel/UC5J6MHgFHfCCkyXEVlqFCpQ">Heylog</a>, releases most of his music as singles. His last Album release was in 2024, and he's released 4 albums total, collectively having 22 songs. Compare that to how many singles he's released, 69, and you can see a clear disparity between the two. (That number isn't even including his releases as Logan, or other alt accounts and features.) This isn't an uncommon thing anymore either. Most artists nowadays focus on a "Streaming First" model, releasing one off singles that <em>sometimes</em> might be part of an album later down the line, but it's mostly just drip feeding one off content every couple months or so to keep the people, or rather the algorithm, satiated. Not just on streaming services, but on social media too.</p>
<p>Nowadays, artists are exponentially more likely to have consistent plays on their music if they keep in the good graces of the social media algorithms. Shortform content used to promote 15-30 seconds of a song, and a lot of people making their songs to only have the substance in those 15-30 second chunks so it can "go viral" is poisoning music as a whole.</p>
<p>Now, I will admit, this is mostly the case with "mainstream" music, or any music that would be considered "mainstream" within the subculture. A good handful of niche scenes don't follow this type of release schedule and it's amazing, but simultaneously, there are subgenres where singles are king and you <em>might</em> get an album or an EP if you're lucky. (Necrotrap.)</p>
<p>I'm also not here to say that if you aren't making albums you're a worthless sellout and you should quit, but I am saying that if you aren't making music for the <em>art,</em> then you are just as bad as modern pop-stars who get 30 people to write their songs to be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCVGpvzcHko">as catchy and broad as possible</a>. There will always be people who make music for the bag, and they will always be shit, but the people who actually express themselves through their art are the ones who truly deserve the recognition for their work. I don't care if your way of expressing yourself is by <a href="https://instagram.com/reel/DOVaFSrEp9z/">screaming into a distorted microphone half naked in a park</a> or creating <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxG-bsxhvLY&amp;list=OLAK5uy_m7MlPmXxxgM-s03qAoO2qBQ70VBLqeVXw">genuine, beautiful, artistic music</a>, if you create it as an extension of yourself, then it should be celebrated. Even if your music is only a minor part of your identity, it's still you.</p>
<h1 id="why-i-quit-spotify">Why I Quit Spotify</h1>
<p>I apologize for that little rant, but I feel it's necessary context to understand why I actually stopped using Spotify.</p>
<p>I firmly believe that artistic intent is the most important thing to consider when consuming art. While I grew up in the streaming era and I do consume music and media via streaming platforms, I have grown to realize that albums are meant to be consumed in one sitting. (Most) artists don't just throw together 10-15 random songs and call it an album, it will have a theme, intent, maybe even <a href="https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_nRjHrtDCmXO0ML13R1Dyn5Xwl_XgVPAXE">connected songs that flow into each other</a>.</p>
<p>That said, Spotify doesn't believe in this intent. Spotify's intent is to serve you ads, not to serve your music in a way that does it justice.</p>
<p>I don't want to participate in a platform that doesn't have my best interest as an artist in their hearts.</p>
<h1 id="what-about-apple-music">What about Apple Music?</h1>
<p>Good point, because <strong>FUCK</strong> Apple, but despite my hatred for the company itself, the platforms and hardware they provide are some of the best. Apple Music pays just below Tidal in terms of money per stream, so I will allow my music to exist there because it's a better way to support me. I don't want to remove myself from EVERY platform except Bandcamp because I understand that will cost me most if not all of my listeners, but I don't want to continue providing my music to a platform that only wants to use me to peddle ads to users.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Fuck Spotify. If you want to enjoy my music, check every other streaming platform or buy my music outright on <a href="https://jvstspeedy.bandcamp.com">Bandcamp</a>.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading this far, and know your support means the absolute world to me. No matter if it's direct on Bandcamp, or indirect on Tidal, the fact you enjoy my music makes me happier than anything else in the world.</p>
