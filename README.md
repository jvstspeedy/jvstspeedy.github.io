## Info
This project uses the [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) SSG, paired with the [Linkita](https://www.getzola.org/themes/linkita/) theme.

Most of MY work is within the ``content/`` directory, but it's easier to parse on the website itself. The only other code I wrote in this directory is in ``templates/injects/``, which serves as an injection point for the ``<head>`` element. Otherwise, there's nothing interesting here that isn't the work of the Zola team, or the author of the theme I used.
