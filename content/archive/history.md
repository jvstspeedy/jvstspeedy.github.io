My history with music, and the beginning of SPΣΣDY <!-- more -->

## The Beginning.
My history with music isn't all that interesting, at least for a while. I grew up in a relatively normal Southern household, mostly listening to country and occasionally some Nu Metal thanks to my dad, but nothing too crazy. Around 2017 or so, I was introduced to Fetty Wap by one of my friends and that got me into rap from around then until 2021.

2021 is where shit really hit the fan with my music taste. COVID was somewhat tapering off and I was relieved to be in the summer after the worst year of school ever. TikTok was still massive, and unbeknownst to me, a song was gaining popularity in the latter half that would change my tastes forever. That would only be after, however, I got introduced into the WORST genre of music ever, but one that I still hold dear to my heart.

## Necrotrap.
March 25, 2022. The first time I ever listened to a Gorejit song, or at least a Gorejit feature.
